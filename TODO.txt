# TODO List:

# Read the LM datasheet to see expected buffervalues??

  check if it is in bypass mode?  prob dont want a fifo here? idk really... maybe this would be a cool design consideration?

# Add conditional print statments to make debugging easier:
  this could be via Serial in, 1,2,3,4 etc prints different phases of the acc measurments to see where the error/ latch is occouring!? this would seriously clean up the printing and make it readable.



# add a float printf equivilent: (psudocode below)
printf(float val, int pre_dec_places){
   pre_dec_places=10^pre_dec_places;
   while (|val|<pre_dec_places){
     print (0);
     pre_dec_places/=10;
   }
   print (val)
}


# test ATAN potential: this would only give us up to 180 degrees of measurment on acc but thats probably okay.
