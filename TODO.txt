# TODO List:
General:

Install ADAFRUIT SENSOR and ADAFRUIT BMP805
Install the BERRY IMU as a library:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

      

    
    
Quaternions:
    Try implimenting these???
    This will help incoorperate yaw and allow for non "flat" flight
    
    
  
  
Sensor(Embedded Software)
  -Tune Cfilter
  -Consider characterising the noise in each axis
  -Vibration testing/ re-tune when the PID works?
  -Consider Kalman Filter? -can probably steal from other repo
  -Pressure sensor(too slow?)
  -Include vector operations? (i j k=rect, and mag, theta, phi)
  -integrate Z acc magnitude to get z velocity to help with height measurments
  -incorperate velocity and position tracking??

  
  
LIPO contol with MKR VIDOR
  -assess battery options?

CMND/STATUS (Embedded Software/ Ground Software)
    -add a little slave to poll for updated commands?
    - get UDP to PC working. (bi-directional)  WIFI_NINA
    - try to make UDP faster and see if it is better than "client"    
    add a function for easy JSON creation.
    -add failsafe for loosing connection/ corrupt data  (WATCHDOG for desired)    
    - Side task: get a streaming ability to server mysql to capture timestamps and values.  Accept JSON in the following format?:
      {"time":,"telem":{"cx": , "cy":, "cz":, "dx":,"dy":,"dz":,"dt":...}}
         time(ms)   measured pos(deg),    desired pos(deg),   desired throtle(deg)
         Plot the MYSQL values>? need to make a db.
         
         
    
PWM (Embedded Software)
  -test arduino libraries with ESC, need to reflash

  
Flight Controller (Embedded Software)
  -esure KI windup cannot happen on the ground
  -Tune PID
  -add hover and killswitch
  -add a normalise function to prevent the thing from taking off super high (high error =high throttle)
  
General (Embedded Software)
  -add failsafe for loosing connection/ corrupt data

Hardware
  -Buy RC contoller
  -Mount the IMU on rubber onto the protoboard. Consider soldering in place to add mass and ruberixing the whole flight board?
  -Add "RollCage" Before flight
  -Add "Killswitch" before flight (can be done in sw?)
