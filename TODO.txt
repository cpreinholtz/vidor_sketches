# TODO List:
  
Sensor(Embedded Software)
  -Tune Cfilter
  -Consider characterising the noise in each axis
  -Vibration testing/ re-tune when the PID works?
  -Consider Kalman Filter? -can probably steal from other repo

CMND/STATUS (Embedded Software/ Ground Software)
    - get UDP to PC working. (bi-directional)  WIFI_NINA
    
    -add failsafe for loosing connection/ corrupt data
    
    - Side task: get a streaming ability to server mysql to capture timestamps and values.  Accept JSON in the following format?:
      {"time":,"telem":{"cx": , "cy":, "cz":, "dx":,"dy":,"dz":,"dt":...}}
         time(ms)   measured pos(deg),    desired pos(deg),   desired throtle(deg)
         Plot the MYSQL values>? need to make a db.
    
PWM (Embedded Software)
  -test arduino libraries with ESC 
  -test vidor output(5v pwm vs 3v3)!!
  -Create function/wrapper for writing to the ESCs
  -Create Calibrate ESC function
  
PID (Embedded Software)
  -Impliment Flight Controller
  -Tune
  
General (Embedded Software)
  -add failsafe for loosing connection/ corrupt data

Hardware
  -Use Protoboard
  -Buy headers (4x3PIN for ESCs), potentially more for redundancy, RC controller
  -Buy RC contoller
  -Mount the IMU on rubber onto the protoboard. Consider soldering in place to add mass and ruberixing the whole flight board?
  -Charge batteries
  -Add "RollCage" Before flight
  -Add "Killswitch" before flight
  
  
  
  Done
    -Read Gyro/Accelerometer
